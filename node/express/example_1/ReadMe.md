# Node Express
## Getting Started


To take this tour do the following:

```
npm install -g express-generator
```

and

```
express example_1
```

then you're done.

Options:

1. Use `supervisor` to auto-reload file changes.

    supervisor -e 'html|js' node ./bin/www

2. Make a controllers folder for a `Users` resource and use that module with the `routes/users.js`
